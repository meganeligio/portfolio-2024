                    <p>
                        IDLE CAFÉ was a concept that I created using the likes of internet cafés and gaming. I combined
                        the two into a project that involved designing a website and brand identity for the fictional
                        café. The focal point of this idea was to have a safe space for gamers — regardless of gender —
                        to enjoy their fun hobbies and encourage inclusivity in the gaming community.

                    <p>
                        When it came to gaming, the ongoing problem of girls being reduced to a separate term called
                        “gamer girls” still existed. It was meant to have a negative connotation, which opened the door
                        for misogynistic behavior. I wanted to find a way to offer a comfort zone where gamers wouldn’t
                        have to worry about facing discrimination. I had to construct a brand identity that embodied
                        this sentiment while using pleasing visual language.

                <h2>solution</h2>

                <p>
                    I invented IDLE CAFÉ, where gamers could hang out in a casual and friendly environment. I designed a
                    website with engaging visuals that catered towards gaming. I formed a brand focused on communicating
                    a warm message stating everyone was welcomed. I created a logo that expressed hospitality by using
                    the shape of a heart. I produced 8bit illustrations that gave off soft vibes.

                    <p>I went with a color palette that held Japanese undertones since the game was centered around
                        anime, which originated from&nbsp;Japan.</p>
